# Context-Aware-LDA (C-LDA)
A generative model for topic segmentation in documents based on a context-aware Latent Dirichlet Allocation. The main difference from conventional models is that the topic of each word is generated by both topic distribution and a set of word pairs in its context.

# Usage:
The file tdt2_em_v4_0_100.npy keeps first 100 documents of TDT2 dataset.
The main program is in the "C_LDA.py" file.
After the training, the topic distribution, word distribution and word pair co-occurrence topic distribution will be returned and saved under the current folder.
The test program is the file "test_CLDA.py".
Run "python test.py" and test the perplexities for C-LDA and traditional LDA.
